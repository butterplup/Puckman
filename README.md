# Puckman: The Game

## Intro
This is an arcade style applet written in Java; it is a Gradle project; the GUI utilises the PApplet class from the processing library.
The game is based off of the game Pac-Man by Bandai Namco. It was created as a personal project to learn about Gradle, and creating visual/interactive GUI.
